# amaterasu-web

Official website for amaterasu. Planning for documentation of discord app and having a dedicated web app.

Timeline: ~~Mid July for v1.0~~ Towards the end of September to be deployed and then keep adding new features after that. Latter not as important but aiming for that first version to be on time. Changed the deadline to align with the plans for Shizuka. This and amaterasu-discord will be released at the same time. As to why it'll be 2 months off, I'm prioritizing finishing yagi and ak-goats first since server merge just happened and that impacts those apps way more

**v1.0**

- Home page: Discord documentation
- Main Eidolon page: List of Eidolons and search function
- Specific Eidolon pages: Descriptions, star buffs, prayers

**Features to be added**

- Archaeology page
- Fish Kings page
- Instance spawns page
- More eido stats
